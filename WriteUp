I opted to use the first method discussed in class - Client now accepts a ServerConnection in its constructor.
This allows us to create a mock server connection, pass it to our client, and perform mock tests on it.  After
doing this I commented out the chunk of code in Client.requestFile that initializes a ServerConnection (since we
already have one).  This approach seemed the simplest to me and in implementation I can say that it did seem that way.

Client.java contains comments indicating refactoring that has been done.

Tests have labels with the text requirement as well as the requirements number on the assignment readme.
